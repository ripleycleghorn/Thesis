    "text-0":"Climate scientists agree: the earth is warming largely due to greenhouse gas emissions. Logically, the most important step is reducing emissions.  But one concern is dealing with historic emissions trapped in the atmosphere.", 
    "text-1":"In a race against the clock, climate governance is embracing a variety of <span id='geoengineering'>geoengineering</span> technologies to eliminate some of these emissions. However, given that these solutions aren’t being paired with meaningful fossil fuel reductions, they will be most likely be used to justify continuing business as usual practices.", 
    "text-2":"This project looks at the nuances of one of these technologies, called Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage, or BECCS. But before we get to the details, let’s take a look back at historic emissions. So how does BECCS work?",
    "text-4":"'The idea is that, as it grows, biomass will continuously capture CO2 from the atmosphere. When the biomass is burned for energy, the waste CO2 will also be captured and stored underground, instead of being released back into the atmosphere. The assumption is that this will result in negative emission'(FOEI).",
    "text-5":"In reality, BECCS is largely unproven and inefficient. To date, there are only a handful of projects worldwide. “There is only one existing BECCS project in the world: the capture of CO2 from corn fermentation at the Decatur ethanol refinery in the USA, owned by ADM. CO2 is captured from the fermentation process and injected into the nearby Mount Simon Sandstone formation. This has been essentially a “proof of concept” project, funded by the Department of Energy (DOE), which claims that it provides a “carbon negative footprint.” In reality, however, since the refinery is powered by fossil fuels and corn is an energy-intensive crop, claiming the project a “success” is premature.” (Big Bad Fix)."
