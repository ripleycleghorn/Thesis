# Exercise 2: First Thesis Prototype 

   The topic of my thesis will be how the 'Green Economy' won't serve as a solution to the current climate crisis, and may in fact worsen it. My sketch shows several 'pages' of storytelling, starting with some context about the current state of climate change and a simple line graph showing global temperatures rising. The next page will show a range of proposed solutions popping up on the screen. I'm not sure what form this will take, but for now I drew it as a network graph since the solutions have some grouping/hierarchy to them. One solution in particular will be highlighted, and zoomed in on, and will be the topic of the next page. That page will define the solution and have some chart explaining its impacts. I will use the same format to demystify one or two other solutions. Then the pagee will return to the original chart showing many solutions, and will highlight how all the solutions we've seen thus far are considered to be part of the Green Economy. The next slide will give a concise explanation why the Green Economy as a whole isn't a real solution. Finally at the end, I will return to the original chart with all the solutions, but this time the 'Green Economy' solutions will be grouped together and alternative solutions will be separately grouped together. The user then has the option of staying on that page and clicking on the individual solutions to learn more about them. 


* Who is the person, demographic, or processional group you are designing for. What do they know about your project already?
    *  I’m designing for anyone who is concerned about the environmental crisis we’re in, and who thinks that green technology will be the solution to this problem

* How is your audience reading your project. In what situation, modality, through which distribution channel, and in what context?
    * My hope is that this piece will be understandable by people concerned with the climate, even if they don't have a lot of experience reading about these issues or solutions. In other words, I don't want it to be heavily academic, but rather the level of approachable that you'd find on a website like ProPublica or New York Times. I imagined it being accessed on a laptop or desktop, but I need to consider having a mobile version as well.

* What does your project ask of your audience, what do they need to do (input, interact, act)?
    * I imagine it will be similar to this visualization (https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/), but instead of scrolling down, there will be a box to click for the next slide
    * I don't want this visualization to be reliant on a large amount of interaction, but instead be able to present pieces of information bit by bit with simple clicks. At the end, the user will have the option of interacting further with the piece in order to explore more, but only after the main storytelling part is accomplished.

* What does your audience take away, instantly, after 1min, 5min of engagement?
    * I’d like them to take away that the green economy is not a solution and may in fact do more harm than good. Also to be skeptical of any new “green technology” that they learn about in the future and to question the context in which those technologies were created.
